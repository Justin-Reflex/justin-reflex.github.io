# Forage Virtual Experience - Telstra Cyberattack

Date: 8/27/2024

<br/><br/>
### Start Simulation

Before starting the simulation, I actually had to look up Telstra as I wasn't familiar with this company. Telstra is a telecomm company based in Australia with similar offerings to AT&T. With that information, I started the simulation and was immediately provided with some background information:

I was also given references, a log file, and an email template to work from.

I've heard of Spring4Shell elsewhere in learning about CVEs, but I definitely needed the provided references to be able to complete this task. I learned that Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965) is a zero-day RCE vulnerability and requires specific conditions: JDK 9+, Apache Tomcat, WAR file format, spring-webmvr or spring-webflux dependencies, and Spring Framework 5.3.17 or ealier (for those using the 5.3 framwork).
