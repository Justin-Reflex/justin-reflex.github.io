# Creating a Phishing Awareness Training Presentation

Date: 8/24/2024

With the rise of phishing emails experienced at the company, we decided to expand our phishing awareness training. It was my job to create a phishing awareness training presentation to help employees better understand what phishing is, how to spot it, and what to do and what not to do when suspecting an email of being a phishing scam.

This first slide I felt was important to highlight the motivation behind phishing campaigns. Not everyone realizes the kind of power and information one can gain from tricking someone into clicking the wrong link.

This second slide was just to provide a simple definition of what phishing actually is. It's simple, but provides important context.

This third slide actually went over a real-world example (from an online example) and is the most important of the slides in this presentation. Everything presented here are the most common metrics to determine if something is genuine or a trap: from generic wording, poor grammar/spelling, unprofessional formatting, over-dramatic urgency, and spoofed links. With this information, hopefully it can give someone just enough doubt so that they seek our support instead of blindly clicking on malicous links.

This final slide summarizes what to look for and emphasizes asking IT. Hopefully the fun pictures and the short-nature of the presentation will get empoyees to remember the necessary information.
