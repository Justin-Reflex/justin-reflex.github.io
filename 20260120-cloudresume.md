# AWS Cloud Resume

Date: 1/20/2026
<br/><br/>

## DESCRIPTION

The AWS Cloud Resume Project is a comprehensive, full-stack serverless application designed to showcase technical expertise by transforming a standard resume into an interactive document hosted by AWS. The architecture involves hosting a responsive frontend on Amazon S3, which is then globally distributed via Amazon CloudFront for low-latency delivery and secured with AWS Certificate Manager. To provide interactive functionality, the project incorporates a visitor counter powered by a backend API. This backend leverages Amazon API Gateway to trigger AWS Lambda functions that interact with an Amazon DynamoDB table, creating a cohesive, live environment that demonstrates the power of cloud-native development.

Completing this project has helped me build a robust foundation in modern cloud engineering and DevOps practices. It provided hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), use of tools like AWS SAM or Terraform to manage resources, and gave me a greater understanding of CI/CD pipelines through using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. Beyond core AWS services, the project emphasizes proficiency in serverless logic, database management, and web security. By bridging the gap between theoretical certification and practical implementation, this project serves as a tangible demonstration of my ability to learn, deploy, and troubleshoot cloud solutions.
