# AWS Cloud Resume

Date: 1/20/2026
<br/><br/>

## DESCRIPTION

The AWS Cloud Resume Project is a comprehensive, full-stack serverless application designed to showcase technical expertise by transforming a standard resume into an interactive document hosted by AWS. The architecture involves hosting a responsive frontend on Amazon S3, which is then globally distributed via Amazon CloudFront for low-latency delivery and secured with AWS Certificate Manager. To provide interactive functionality, the project incorporates a visitor counter powered by a backend API. This backend leverages Amazon API Gateway to trigger AWS Lambda functions that interact with an Amazon DynamoDB table, creating a cohesive, live environment that demonstrates the power of cloud-native development.

Completing this project has helped me build a robust foundation in modern cloud engineering and DevOps practices. It provided hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), use of tools like AWS SAM or Terraform to manage resources, and gave me a greater understanding of CI/CD pipelines through using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. Beyond core AWS services, the project emphasizes proficiency in serverless logic, database management, and web security. By bridging the gap between theoretical certification and practical implementation, this project serves as a tangible demonstration of my ability to learn, deploy, and troubleshoot cloud solutions.

## TOOLS & SKILLS USED

Technical Tools & Services

    Databases: Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL data storage and state management (visitor tracking).

    Networking & Security: Amazon Route 53 for DNS management and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for SSL/TLS encryption.

    API Management: Amazon API Gateway for creating and managing RESTful endpoints.

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC): AWS SAM, Terraform, or CloudFormation for defining infrastructure as version-controlled code.

    CI/CD & Version Control: GitHub Actions for automated deployment pipelines and Git for source code management.

Core Skills Gained

    Serverless Architecture Design: Designing decoupled, event-driven systems that scale automatically without managing servers.

    Frontend-to-Backend Integration: Connecting a static frontend to a dynamic backend API via asynchronous JavaScript (CORS, Fetch API).

    DevOps Automation: Building continuous integration and delivery pipelines to ensure code quality and automated deployments.

    Identity & Access Management (IAM): Implementing the principle of least privilege by configuring specific IAM roles and policies for cloud services.

    Cloud Security Best Practices: Configuring bucket policies, origin access identities (OAI/OAC), and managing SSL certificates for secure web traffic.

    Infrastructure Management: Transitioning from manual console configuration to repeatable, code-based environment provisioning.
    
- AWS Lambda: compute and logic, using JavaScript (or Python) for serverless backend processing.
- Amazon S3: storage and hosting.
- Amazon CloudFront: global edge caching and HTTPS content delivery.
- 
- Skills: programming languages, IT / security concepts
